          Hi, I&apos;m Ashish, a web developer and UI/UX designer with a passion
          for creating beautiful, functional, and user-centered digital
          experiences. With 5+ years of experience in the field. I am always
          looking for new and innovative ways to bring Consumers visions to
          life.
          <p className="font-medium">
            I believe that design is about more than just making things look
            pretty â€“ it&apos;s about solving problems and creating intuitive,
            enjoyable experiences for users.
