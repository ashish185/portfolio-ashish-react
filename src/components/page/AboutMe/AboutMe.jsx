          Hi, I&apos;m CodeBucks, a web developer and UI/UX designer with a

          experiences. With 4 years of experience in the field. I am always

          I believe that design is about more than just making things look
          pretty â€“ it&apos;s about solving problems and creating intuitive,
          enjoyable experiences for users.
        </p>
        <p className="font-medium">
          Whether I&apos;m working on a website, mobile app, or other digital
          product, I bring my commitment to design excellence and user-centered
          thinking to every project I work on. I look forward to the opportunity
          to bring my skills and passion to your next project.
